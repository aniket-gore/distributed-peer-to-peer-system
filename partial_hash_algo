1. Create a partial lookup request to any alive node
2. The exposed method will hash key/rel and will create all combination of the empty rel/key
3. There are three methods involved:

L - exposed lookup the client will contact - add function which identify whether full or partial lookup
l - unexposed actual lookup on both - key and relation

PL - another exposed method - that L will forward requests to
pl - unexposed lookup called by PL - that will search the db given a key or a relation 


if full lookup forward it to another L
l will be called 
else if partial forward i to another PL
pl will be caled 



L - will handle merging of the responses from PL

response from L
if partial:
{“result”: [[“keyA”, “relA”, {“a”:3, “b”:[1,2,3]} ] [“keyA”, “relA”, {“a”:4, “b”:[1,2,3,4]} ]], “error”: null}


if full:
{“result”: [“keyA”, “relA”, {“a”:3, “b”:[1,2,3]} ], “error”: null}
